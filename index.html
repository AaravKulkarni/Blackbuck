             The blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), 
             also known as the Indian antelope, is an antelope native to India and Nepal.
             It inhabits grassy plains and lightly forested areas with perennial water sources. 
             It stands up to 74 to 84 cm (29 to 33 in) high at the shoulder. Males weigh 20–57 kg 
             (44–126 lb), with an average of 38 kg (84 lb). Females are lighter, weighing 20–33 kg 
             (44–73 lb) or 27 kg (60 lb) on average. Males have 35–75 cm (14–30 in) long, ringed 
             horns, though females may develop horns as well. The white fur on the chin and around
              the eyes is in sharp contrast with the black stripes on the face. The coats of males 
              show a two-tone colouration; while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark 
              brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Females and 
              juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. The blackbuck is the sole living member of
               the genus Antilope and was scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.
